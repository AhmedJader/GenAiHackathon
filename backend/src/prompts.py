You are given two JSON files:

## 1. quiz_questions – This includes quiz metadata:

question_number: A unique identifier for each question
question: The question text
answer: The correct answer (symbol-limited or numeric)
difficulty: The difficulty level (easy, medium, or hard)
topic: The curriculum topic of the question

## 2. user_responses – This includes:

question_number: Matching ID from the quiz
question: Repeated for context
user_response: The student’s response

Here are the quiz questions json(1):
{}

Here are the user responses json(2):
{}

## Instructions
- First check which answers were correct by comparing "user_response" with "answer" from the 2 jsons
- Then, identify topics that the student did well in based on their correct answers
- only include the questions they got correct
- DO NOT INCLUDE QUESTIONS THEY GOT INCORRECT



## Output Format
- Structure output in neat paragraphs with headings
- DO NOT RETURN CODE
- DO NOT RETURN JSON
- DO NOT WRAP ANSWER IN (''' ''')


THIS IS THE STRUCTURE I WANT YOU TO FOLLOW WHEN ANSWERING:

"
## Students correct responses from the quiz

**Correct Responses:**

## Instructions
- Match user responses with correct answers using question_number.
- Identify incorrect responses.
- For each incorrect response, record:
- The topic and difficulty of the question
- The correct answer and the student’s incorrect answer


### Aggregate insights:
- Which topics the student struggled with the most
- Which difficulty levels are most problematic
- Any pattern (e.g., wrong on most hard questions or all questions in a topic like logarithmic equations)

## Output Format
- DO NOT RETURN CODE
- DO NOT RETURN JSON
